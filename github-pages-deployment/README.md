## Prerequisites

Before you start, you should have the following:

- A GitHub account
- A project folder containing the files for your website (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.)

## Getting Started

1. **Create a new repository** on GitHub:
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in.
   - Click the **+** icon in the top-right corner and select **New repository**.
   - Name your repository (e.g., `your-website-name`), and choose whether you want it to be public or private.
   - Initialize the repository with a README file.

2. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
   - Open your terminal or Git Bash.
   - Clone the repository using the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-website-name.git
     ```
   - Navigate to the repository directory:
     ```bash
     cd your-website-name
     ```

3. **Add your website files**:
   - Place your HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and any other necessary files in the repository folder.
   
4. **Commit your changes**:
   - Add the files to Git:
     ```bash
     git add .
     ```
   - Commit the changes:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Initial commit with website files"
     ```
   - Push the changes to GitHub:
     ```bash
     git push origin main
     ```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - On your GitHub repository page, go to **Settings**.
   - Scroll down to the **Pages** section.
   - Under **Source**, select the branch you want to deploy (typically `main`).
   - Choose the root directory as the source.
   - Click **Save**.

2. **Access your deployed site**:
   - After a few minutes, your website will be live at `https://your-username.github.io/your-website-name/`.
   - Share this link to access your site online.

## Customizing Your Site

- You can customize your site by editing the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in the repository.
- After making changes, remember to commit and push the changes to GitHub:
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Updated website content"
  git push origin main
